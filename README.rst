Genemap is a python library for mapping (gene) identifiers. Genemaps main
purpose is provide an easy approach for mapping (gene) identifers from one
identifier type to another, which is unfortunately often not a trivial task.
This may be useful for translating identifiers into a format that you are more
familiar with (such as gene symbols instead of Ensembl IDs) or even for
translating between different species (e.g., from mouse IDs to human IDs)
to compare datasets or annotations between species.
